# Tally-Counter-Turtle-Python - by zaid-hassan
A simple tally counter written in python3.11 using turtle module.
Press 'C' or 'c' to count and 'R' or 'r' to reset the counter to 0.
If you have a Python interpretter installed on your computer you can run python3 tallycounter.py and a turtle window will open.
If you dont have a Python interpretter installed on your computer you can run the Tally Counter.exe by double clicking it and it will open a turtle window.
You might not have the fonts that i used in this tallycounter. I have added a folder that contains those fonts you can download and install the fonts and then you are good to go. (You can skip this step the tally counter will still work, just with a different font.)
Thankyou
